Allegro Scrabble Clone (for C++ Uni Assignment)

by Joshua Stewart (Aek)

My program needs the following files to run properly:
	
	data.dat 	- animation and bitmap graphics
	all3939.dll	- dll for Allegro graphics library


More information about the Allegro Game Library can be found at
http://alleg.sourceforge.net/


---- Source Information ----
Visit my page for the source files.

I used MSVC 6 to build this.. you'll need to do the same. 
I have included prebuilt Allegro libraries and dll's needed for building the project.

Also i doubt it will port very well over to Linux or Dos (it uses MFC), 
if anyone cares to try.. let me know the results. Thanks

This game is an example of building Win32 console based games with Allegro that 
use MFC collection classes. I can only get allegro to play nice with MFC if i use
Win32 console. So if you need to use MFC for support classes (god only knows why 
(maybe for a C++ assignment perhaps? :)) then this is a good place to start if 
you are a newbie with MFC/Win32 Allegro

Feel free to ask me questions about my code, reuse parts of my code, or use the 
graphics from the data.dat.

Enjoy
